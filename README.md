# nostr-map

Read and leave **nostr notes on a map**.

This is running at [notes.trustroots.org](https://notes.trustroots.org/). And it is part of our effort to [nostrify trustroots](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots).


## Getting started

- Install node and yarn
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`
- Open http://localhost:1234


## Some ideas

- filters
  - [ ] user on trustroots?
  - [ ] filter on hashtags
- add a chat
  - only show notes in the part of the map that is visible
  - bridge to signal/matrix hitchwiki chat
- rideshare related tags
- update location with regular interval
- event hashtags
- pull in data from https://hitchmap.com/
