# nostr-map

Read and leave **nostr notes on a map**.

This is running at [notes.trustroots.org](https://notes.trustroots.org/). And it is part of our effort to [nostrify trustroots](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots).

## Getting started

- Install nvm
- `nvm install` - This is only required one time
- `nvm use`

Then run yarn from corepack. There are 2 ways to do this. If you have yarn
installed globally, you can uninstall it. Or you can run `corepack yarn` instead
of `yarn`.

- `yarn`
- `yarn start`
- Open http://localhost:1234

## Ideas

somewhat concrete:

- [filters](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostr-map/issues/13)
- [chat](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostr-map/issues/14)

vague-ish:

- rideshare related tags
- update location with regular interval
- hashtags, e.g. for circles or events, #hg24 for hitchgathering 2024?
